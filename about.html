        <h3>Designer & Developer</h3>
        <p>I'm a 19 year old designer and developer from New York City that specializes in Web Development,  UX/UI Design, 3D Art, and Graphic Design. 
            My biggest aspiration is to become an industry leading Game Developer. This project is the first of many on my Game Developer journey.

        <h1>Project</h1>
        <p>Bomberman Reloaded is a matching game inspired by the popular Nintendo franchise Bomberman. The board starts with a random assortment of 
            colored bombs. Match at least 3 bombs to detonate them. The more bombs you match at once, the more points you'll recieve. Detonate as 
            many bomb-matches as you can and get the highest score before running out of moves.
        </p>
